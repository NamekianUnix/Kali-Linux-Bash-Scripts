# Kali-Linux-Bash-Scripts
I'm tired of updating my Kali Linux scripts across multiple machines and seeing different versions of my bash scripts each time I boot up a VM, Live USB, or a native install of Kali Linux.
So I'm updating, cleaning, and moving all of my scripts to here. You may find them useful to automate your Kali Linux environment.
I highly recommend you read the code of my scripts before running them. 
I typically add useful comments and warnings to each script to give you proper expectations.
May the source be with you.
